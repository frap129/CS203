In addition to the NQueensExauhstiveSearch.java and NQueensIterativeRepair.java
files required, I created an NQueensMain class that acts as a controller to run
both solutons to the N-Queens profile and log the necessary data. While this 
class is not required, it made testing and development of this project easier.
